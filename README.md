# Mousenger
Mousenger is an open-source chat program written in Python
with separated server and client-sided programs.

Mousenger client program relies on PyQt6 for GUI.
The server program relies on mysql-connector-python for database management.
Both sides also include some packages in the Python standard library,
which don't need extra effort to install before the use of Mousenger.

Enjoy!

PS: The reason that this program is named so,
is because I like mouse, and it sometimes resembles my own lifestyle quite well.
